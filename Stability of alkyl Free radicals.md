# What is it?
Free radicals formed from [[Homolysis of a bond fission]]

It is similar to [[Stability of Carbocation]]

[[Free radicals]] are electron deficient species where carbon carries a single unpaired electron. Alkyl groups due to their +I effect can release electrons. More the number of alkyl groups attached to a carbon radical, more is the availability of electrons and more is the stabilization of [[Free radicals]]. Thus, electron deficiency in carbon radicals is compensated to maximum in tertiary radicals due to the presence of three alkyl groups.
