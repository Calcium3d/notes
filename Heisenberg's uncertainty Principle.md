# What is it?
According to the Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle,
>	It is Impossible to measure simultaneously both the position and the momentum of a microscopic particle with absolute accuracy or certainty

$$\Delta x.\Delta P \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}$$
where $\Delta P$ is the change in momentum
and $\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in measurement of position
