# Nomenclature
$\ce{R-COOCO}$ 
R is a alkyl group which has 1 Hydrogen less than [[Alkane]]

## Conditions
1) Find the longest chain of carbon atoms
2) Outside the chain there is substitutes
3) Numbering from the nearer side $\ce{COOCO}$ group
4) Naming should be in alphabetical order
5) Write first substituent then chain name
6) If same thing is repeated twice, 'di' will be prefix & so on
7) Between number nad number there is coma
8) BEtween number and word there is dash
