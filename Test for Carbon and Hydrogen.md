# Qualitative Analysis

## Reaction

$\ce{Organic \space Compound ->[CuO] CO2 + H2O}$


### Detecting Carbon Dioxide
$\ce{CO2 + Ca(OH)2 -> CaCO3 v + H2O}$

Carbon present in the organic compound is oxidised to CO2. Carbon dioxide formed turns lime water milky. This indicates the presence of carbon in the organic compounds.

### Detection of Hydrogen
$\ce{5H2O + CuSO4 -> CuSO4.5H2O}$

Hydrogen present in the organic compounds is oxidised to water, water formed converts anhydrous $\ce{CuSO4}$ to $\ce{CuSO4.5H2O}$. This indicates the presence of hydrogen in the organic compound
