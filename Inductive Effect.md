# What is it?
When there is a displacement of Sigma electrons from [[Sigma Bond]] along a saturated carbon chain, whenever an electron withdrawing or electron donating group is present at the end of the chain is called inductive effect

# Types
1) [[+I Effect]]
2) [[-I Effect]]

# Feature
1) Inductive Effect operate through [[Sigma Bond]]
2) It is permanent and irreversible
3) Inductive Effect falls off with with distance. It weakens after third carbon atom

# Order of decreasing inductive Effect

# Uses
1) [[Stability of Carbocation]]
2) [[Stability of alkyl Free radicals]]
3) [[Acidic nature of Carboxylic acids]]
4) [[Reactivity of alkyl halides]]
5) [[Basic nature of Amine]]
