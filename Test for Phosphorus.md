# Qualitative Analysis

If phosphorus is present in the organic compound, the SFE would contain Sodium Phosphate

$$\ce{Na + P ->[\Delta][Na2O2] Na3PO4}$$

Sodium phosphate ($\ce{Na3PO4}$)is boiled with nitric acid ($\ce{HNO3}$) and then treated with ammonium molybdate ($\ce{(NH4)2MoO4}$) 
A yellow ppt indicates the presence of phosphorus

$$\ce{Na3PO4 + 3HNO3 -> H3PO4 + 3NaNO3}$$
$$\ce{H3PO4 + 12(NH4)2MoO4 + 21HNO3 -> (NH4)3PO4.12MoO3 + 21NH4NO3 + 12H2O}$$

# Quantitative Analysis
## Ammonium phosphomolybdate ($\ce{(NH4)3PO4.12MoO4}$)
#### For Finding 
$$\ce{\frac{Atomic mass of P}{Molecular mass of $\ce{(NH4)3PO4.12MoO4}$} * \frac{Mass of $\ce{(NH4)3PO4.12MoO4}$}{Mass of Organic Compound} * 100 }$$

## Magnesium pyrophosphate ($\ce{Mg2P2O7}$)
#### For Finding 
$$\ce{\frac{Atomic mass of P}{Molecular mass of $\ce{Mg2P2O7}$} * \frac{Mass of $\ce{Mg2P2O7}$}{Mass of Organic Compound} * 100 }$$
