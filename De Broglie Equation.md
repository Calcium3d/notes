Einstein in 1905AD suggested that [[Light]] has a dual nature. Which means it behaves like a [[Waves]] as well as a [[Particle]].

De Broglie said:
	"All Material particles in motion posses character"
$$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$$
$\lambda$ associated with a particle of mass moving with velocity v is given by the relation

h = Planck's constant

# Derivation of the Equation
Consider a photon having energy = $E$

According to [[Planck's Quantum Theory]]
$$E = h \mu = h \frac{c}{\lambda}$$
Take this as equation 1

According to Einstein,
$$E = mc^2$$

Take this as equation 2

Combining both of the equations, we get

$$h \frac{c}{\lambda} = mc^2$$
This can be then written as

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{mc}$$
similarly, for other particles having velocity V,
$$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$$

also can be written as

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$
where p is momentum

$$\therefore \lambda \propto \frac{1}{p}$$
