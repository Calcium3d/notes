# What is it?
Hund's rule deals with [[Orbital Series]] and states that: 

1) No electron pairing takes place in the orbitals with equivalent energy untill each orbital in the given subshell contains one electron and the spins of any unpaired electron are parallel
2) When different orbitals of same energy are half or less than half filled, the electrons should have parallel electrons

Electrons first seek to fill all the orbitals with similar energy before pairing with another electron in a half filled orbital.
