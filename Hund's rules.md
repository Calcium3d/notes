# What is it?
Hund's rule deals with [[Orbital Series]] and states that: 

1) Every orbital in a sublevel is singly occupied before any orbital is doubly occupied
2) All of the electrons in a singly occupied orbital have the same spin 

Electrons first seek to fill all the orbitals with similar energy before pairing with another electron in a half filled orbital.
