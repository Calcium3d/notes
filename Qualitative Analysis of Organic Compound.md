As we know, Carbon is the main constituent element of all organic compounds. Hydrogen is also present in maximum organic compounds, few exceptions: $\ce{CCl4}$

Elements other than carbon and hydrogen, such as nitrogen, sulphur and halogens and phosphorus may also be present in organic compounds

# Objective
1) [[Test for Carbon and Hydrogen]]
2) [[Test for Nitrogen]]
3) [[Test for Sulphur]]
4) [[Test for Halogens]]
5) [[Test for Phosphorus]]

In the test for [[Test for Sulphur]], [[Test for Nitrogen]], [[Test for Halogens]], [[Test for Phosphorus]], we use [[Lassaigne's test]]
