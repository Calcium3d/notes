# What is it?
Special type of [[Resonance]] in which functional group is bonded with unsaturated carbon.

It is when a lone pair shifts and then a [[Pie Bond]] shifts, then it is mesomeric effect. 

# Types
[[+m mesomerism]]
[[-m mesomerism]]

# Application of Mesomeric Effect
1) [[Stability of Carbocation]]
2) [[Basic nature of Amine]]
3) [[Acidic nature of OH]]
4) [[Ring reaction]]
5) [[Bond Strength]]
6) [[Dipole moment]]

## Decreasing order of [[+m mesomerism]] groups are

$$\ce{-NH2 > -NH-R > -NR2 > -OH > -OCH3}$$

## Decreasing order of [[-m mesomerism]] groups are
$$\ce{-NO2 > -NR3^+ > -CHO > -CN-}$$
