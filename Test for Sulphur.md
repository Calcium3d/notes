# Qualitative Analysis

## Lead Acetate Test
Sodium Sulphide formed during the preparation of SFE reacts with lead acetate to form lead sulphide ($\ce{PbS}$)

$$\ce{Na2S + (CH3COO)2Pb -> Pbs v + 2CH3COONa}$$
This can also be written as 
$$\ce{S^{2-} + Pb^{2+} -> PbS}$$

## Sodium Nitroprusside test

$\ce{Na2S}$ formed during the preparation of SFE reacts with sodium nitroprusside to form sodium thionitroprusside

$$\ce{Na2S + Na2[Fe(CN)5NO] -> Na4[Fe(CN)5NOS]}$$

# Quantitative Analysis
## Carius Method
#### For Finding 
$$\ce{\frac{Atomic mass of S}{Molecular mass of $\ce{BaSO4}$} * \frac{Mass of $\ce{BaSO4}$}{Mass of Organic Compound} * 100 }$$
