If nitrogen is present in the organic compound, the sodium fusion extract, or lassaigne's extract would contain sodium [[cyanide]].

$$\ce{Na + C + N ->[\Delta] NaCN}$$

Sodium [[cyanide]] first reacts with iron(II) sulphate and forms sodium hexacyano-ferrate(II), $\ce{Na4[Fe(CN)6]}$

On heating with $\ce{conc.H2SO4}$, some iron(II) ions are oxidised to produce iron(III) hexa cyanoferrate(II) / ferric ferrocyanide, 
$\ce{Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3.xH2O}$ which is Prussian blue in colour

$\ce{FeSO4 + NaCN -> Na4[Fe(CN)6] ->[conc.H2SO4] Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3.xH2O}$
