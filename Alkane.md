# Nomenclature
## Conditions
1) Find the longest chain of carbon atoms
2) Outside the chain there is substitutes
3) Numbering from the nearer side of substitutes
4) Naming should be in alphabetical order
5) Write first substituent then chain name
6) If same thing is repeated twice, 'di' will be prefix & so on
7) Between number nad number there is coma
8) BEtween number and word there is dash

# [[Hybridisation]]

![[Pasted image 20220602191150.png]]
Following [[Hund's rules]], these orbitals are filled

Thus, when in excited state, it requires one s and p^3 to complete the orbitals. this [[hybridisation]] state is known as $\ce{sp^3}$  

This is always shown under alkanes
