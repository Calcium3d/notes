1) The energy is absorbed or emitted by a body discontinuously in the form of small packets
2) Each packed of energy is called quantum and in case of light, the quantum of energy is called a photon
3) The energy of a photon depends upon the [[Frequency]] of [[Radiation]] and the two are related as: 
	$E = h \mu$
