# What is it?
When the same molecular formula represents two compounds which differ in the spatial arrangement of atoms or groups around carbon-carbon double bonds, or [[Alkene]], then such isomers are called geometrical isomers and the phenomenon is known as geometrical [[isomerism]]

# Example

Even though both are But-2-ene, it has been found that placing something around the carbon-carbon double bond, changes its physical properties

The first one is known as Cis But-2-ene because both alkyl groups are on the same side
The second one is known as trans But-2-ene because both alkyl groups are on opposite sides

here too, since the first one has both Chlorine on the same side, it is known as cis 1,2-Dichloro ethene. 
The second one, since it has Chlorine on opposite ends, is known as trans 1,2-DiChloro ethene.

# Conditions for Geometrical [[Isomerism]]
1) The molecule must have a double bond
2) There must be tow different atoms or groups attached to each carbon atom of the double bond. If one or both the carbons of the double bond carry two similar atoms or groups, then there is no geometrical [[isomerism]] 

# Characteristics of Geometrical [[Isomerism]]
1) the geometrical isomers have similar chemical properties, since they contain the same functional group. 
2) The geometrical isomers have different physical properties like melting point, boiling point, dipole moments etc
