# What is it?
When two or more compounds having the same molecular formula contain different functional groups, the phenomenon is known as functional [[isomerism]] and such compounds are known as functional isomers.

# Example
## Hydrocarbon with single oxygen
there are a 4 examples
1) [[Alcohol]]
2) [[Ether]]
3) [[Aldehyde]]
4) [[Ketones]]


if it follows [[Alkane]]:
[[Alcohol]]
[[Ether]]

if not:
[[Aldehyde]]
[[Ketones]]

## Hydrocarbon with double oxygen
There are 2
1) [[Carboxylic acids]]
2) [[Esters]]


## Hydrocarbon with Nitrogen
There are 3
1) [[Cyanide]]
2) [[Isocyanide]]
3) [[Amine]]

### For [[amine]]
#### with $\ce{C4H_{11}N}$
