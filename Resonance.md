# What is it?
It is the phenomenon, in which a molecule is represented by several electronic structure which do not differ much in their energy and are obtained by oscillation of [[Pie Bond]], is called resonance. Such structures are called canonical forms and the molecule is said to be a resonance hybrid of these canonical forms.

# Rules for writing resonance
1) All the contributing structure must be genuine [[Lewis Structure]]. They must follow the rules of valency. 
2) In the contributing structure, the relative position of the nuclei remain the same; only the lone pair and the pie bond pair of electrons differ.
