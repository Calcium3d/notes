# What is it?
Optical isomers which are non superimposable mirror images of each other are called enantiomers and the phenomenon is called optical [[isomerism]] or enantiomerism.

This can also be explained as the four conditions:
1) [[Chiral Carbon Atom]]
2) Asymmetric centre
3) Non superimposable mirror image
4) It can rotate the plane of the polarised light in opposite direction

There are thus two forms
1) [[Dextrorotatory]]
2) [[Levorotatory]]
