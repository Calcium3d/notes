# Qualitative Analysis

IF halogens is present in the organic compound, the SFE or lassaigne's extract would contain sodium halide ($\ce{NaCl,NaBr, NaI}$)

$$\ce{Na + $\underset{\text{(Cl,Br,I) }}x$ ->[\Delta] Na$x$}$$

## Silver nitrate test
### Chlorine
If chlorine is present in organic compound, then SFE would contain $\ce{NaCl}$
$\ce{NaCl}$ gives a white / silver ppt of $\ce{AgCl}$ with $\ce{AgNO3}$ solution. The ppt is soluble in ammonium hydroxide ($\ce{NH4OH}$) 

$$\ce{NaCl + AgNO3 -> AgCl + NaNO3}$$

### Bromine
If bromine present in organic compound then SFE would contain $\ce{NaBr}$
$\ce{NaBr}$ gives pale yellow precipitate of $\ce{AgBr}$ with $\ce{AgNO3}$ solution. This ppt is sparingly soluble in ammonium hydroxide ($\ce{NH4OH}$)

$$\ce{NaBr + AgNO3 -> AgBr v + NaNO3}$$

### Iodine
If Iodine is present in organic compound then SFE would contain $\ce{NaI}$
$\ce{NaI}$ gives yellow precipitate of $\ce{AgI}$ with $\ce{AgNO3}$ solution. 

$$\ce{NaI + AgNO3 -> AgI v + NaNO3}$$

# Quantitative Analysis
## Carius Method

everything is determined through $\ce{Agx}$ where x is the halogen

#### For Finding 
$$\ce{\frac{Atomic mass of X}{Molecular mass of $\ce{AgBr}$} * \frac{Mass of $\ce{AgBr}$}{Mass of Organic Compound} * 100 }$$
